Indeed, I have been in a perpetual grin ever since our merry and joyful last meeting. It relieves my anxious mind to know that I will be seeing you soon. I am desperately in need of another meeting. Without you near, I am thrown into a state of panic. The thought of being without you for another second terrifies me. So please, humor me and make sure that our next rollick comes soon. I know that it will put a smile on my face. Love, Alice")["ANXIETY"]);
